Hi baby awu, so that means we have a date on valentines no? Well first of all, I want to apologize to you for taking so long to ask you as my date. I wanted to do something special for you and didn't want to just ask you with nothing in mind and so I made this (not an original ideal actually). I saw a video on tiktok on the page you were on before this HAHAHAHA. I thought it was cute so I figured maybe I should make one too but with more to offer. Well, I'll let you experience the whole thing without spoiling it in this short letter. I just want you to know that I really love you and I am thankful for you staying with me despite all our arguments and misunderstandings. I am grateful for how patient you are and how much you care about me to the point that you think of me first rather than yourself. I am very proud of what you've become, my love. I've only seen you grow throughout senior high til today but you've grown so much compared to how you were when we first met each other. I am proud of all your accomplishments and your will to strive for a better future. Seeing you work hard to make a better future for not just yourself, but also your own family makes me jealous of how selfless you can be. Sometimes you go over the top of being selfless tho :/. Asides that, I'm really thankful that I get to spend Valentines Day with you for another year. I love you, baby! I always will.     -jikob
